# AnimalTradingCards
This is my first project that I've created during the Front-end development Nanodegree of Udacity. I had to recreate a animal trading card with my favorite animal.

## Usage

The project must not be used to pass the tests of the Nanodegree program.

The image was found on Google/Pinterest and can be found [here](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/aa/6a/fb/aa6afb304012000b14c9be25fee80154--monkey-kingdom-capuchin-monkeys.jpg). I have no copyrights on this and you must not use the image!

## The Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree

More information about the Nanodegree program can be found [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The code contains suggestions of the review of a Udacity employer. These were just two slightly changes but I want to make sure that I won't forget to contribute this.
